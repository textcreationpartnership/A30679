    _ CHAP. V. Sheweth about what time the Kings Writs were firſt framed for the induction of the Commons into the Parliaments of England.

    _ CHAP. VI. Sheweth the difference between Parliamentary Priviledges, and the Priviledges of the King; and ſheweth how at firſt Kingly Government was conſtituted by God himſelf, and that by Gods Law alſo the Legiſlative Power, and the Power of the Militia was given to the King; and that in theſe higheſt Points of the Kings Prerogative, the Law of England is agreeing with the Law of God, and that God is vindex ſui Ordinis, the avenger of his own Ordinance.

    _ CHAP. VII. Sheweth that vindictive Juſtice is alſo derived from God to the King as Supream, and that all Subordinate Officers derive their Juriſdiction from the King, and through his Mediation from God alſo, and that herein the Law of England is alſo agreeing with the Law of God.

    _ CHAP. VIII. Sheweth that the Subjects of England are bound by their bond of Allegiance to ſerve the King only in his Wars, and that the King is the Fountain of Honour: and by way of Induction to the ſame, ſomething is ſaid of a Countee Palatine, Davids worthies, and good old Barzillai the Gileadite.

    _ CHAP. X. Herein you have an Heir defined, and divided, and is ſhewed, that the Right Heir of the Crown ought not, nor can lawfully be Diſinherited; that a Baſtard ought not, nor can be Heir to the Crown; and further ſomething is ſaid to the late Bill for the Excluſion of the late moſt Illuſtrious Prince James Duke of York, now our Soveraign Lord, King James the Second.
